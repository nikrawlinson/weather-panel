# weather-panel

Python project to produce a weather information screen using an Inky wHAT e-ink display and a Raspberry Pi. Runs well on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Use crontab to refresh the display every 15 minutes or so.

Requires a free OpenWeatherMap API key, which you can sign up for [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Also uses the [PyOWN library](https://pypi.org/project/pyowm/
)
